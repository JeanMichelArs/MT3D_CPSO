**MT3D CPSO** is a project to use Competitive Particle Swarm Algorithm in order to solve and produce statistics for 3D Magnetotelluric inverse problems.

Resolving MT 3D problems with a fine resolution is constrained by computationnal power. While derivative based methods quickly converge toward a solution, due to higly mutli-modal MT cost-function, there no certainty on their solution. On the other hand, stochatic methods such as Monte Carlo explore the parameter space and provide a posteriori bayesian statistics on the solution. However in 3D high dimension problems (n > 100), computationnal power is yet unsufficient to perform such simulations. Here we propose to use a simple method (CPSO) which both converge fastly around a local minima and explore sufficiently the parameter space to provide uncertainties on the solutions.
