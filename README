- Project :
Use CPSO algorithm with hihg number of parameters and even higher number of 
models for fast convergence

A: TEST convergence using a basic cost function 
   Move Run into scratchdir for faster computation

B: I/O   
   Modify MT3D_XXX_.py I/O to write outputs in netcdf file
   Keep a Reference Run for TESTS

C: Chained Jobs
   Modify MT3D_XXX_.py to read/write in appropriate netcdf file
   
   inputs : n_iter_prec (total iteration since beginning of simulation)
            X_opt_prec(n_model), Gfit_prec(n_model) : previous best models 
            and misfits
   outputs: n_it (total number of iteration at the end)
            X_opt, Gfit
	    E(n_it - n_it_prec, n_model) : historic of misfits values
            X(n_it - n_it_prec, n_model) : historic of models 
   
   TEST : against REFERENCE 1 Job run

   ! It is a matter of conception to choose rather to write everything into
   the same file or to write in separate files and to concatenate results into
   One big file ?

D: Mackie
   Add Mackie to get the real coast function
   Test that 1 Job 33 param we obtain similar results 
   Test N Jobs 

E: REAL_CONFIG
   Set up and RUN realistic configuration with high number of parameters 


CHAINED_DATARMOR : 
	Automatic generation of pbs scripts and maybe python to break walltime
	Still in devloppement
