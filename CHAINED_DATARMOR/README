Chained project objective is to break both wall-time limit and memory

Wall-time limit:
N_jobs automatically generated .pbs and .py files 
each Job writes results xopt, (also position vector) ea.model, ea.energy 
Next job reads xopt and positions

Generated scripts are made in Auto folder

Files to be edited are MT3D_CPSO_datar_chained.py and mt3d_cpso_chained.pbs

-------- MT3D_CPSO_datar_chained.py-------------
- output from mt3d are written netcdf file 
this file name has to be edited outfile = method + '_' + mysfit + '_' + config + '.nc'

- stochopy I/O modified

cpso algorithm needs history of best model for each individual in the swarm pbest
pbest is computed from best mysfit of each individual

The Best model (of the best) gbest is retrieved from previous x_opt

it_prev is total number of previous iteration
