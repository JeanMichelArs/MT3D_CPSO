Aim is to create Njobs chained Jobs to increase wall-time
Automatically generated pbs script usigin a generic pbs script

Make sure you edited MT3D_CPSO_datar_chained.py and mt3d_cpso_chained.pbs
See ../README for more information

To generate files EDIT mk_files
	Ex:
	RUN_DIR="/home2/scratch/jcollin/MT3D_CPSO/BASIC_FUN_2_JOBS/"
	n_jobs=10
	max_iter=50 (total number of iteration)
	CONFDIR=... (were all the inputs are located)

> ./mk_files

Makefile will help

To avoid premature convergence outfile.nc in RUN_DIR must be deleted
> make rundirclean

After files are produced to automatically copy DATA of configuration and chained files 
into RUN_DIR 
- EDIT Makefile 
EX : RUN_DIR=/home2/scratch/jcollin/MT3D_CPSO/BASIC_FUN_2_JOBS/
     CONF_DIR=/home2/datahome/jcollin/MT3D_CPSO/Config/
> make cp_file



To clean Directory type make clean
